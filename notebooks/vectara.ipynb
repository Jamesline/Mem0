    "## Cookbook for using VectaraDB with Embedchain\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted GenAI and semantic search platform that provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or [RAG](https://vectara.com/grounded-generation/), which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal knowledge (vector+text) store. Thus, when using Vectara with EmbedChain you do not need to call a separate embedder model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and [MMR](https://vectara.com/get-diverse-results-and-comprehensive-summaries-with-vectaras-mmr-reranker/))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An option to create [generative summary](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview), based on the retrieved documents, including citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Vectara API documentation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the API.\n",
    "\n",

It offers a hybrid retrieval model that includes exact keyword matches, disabling neural retrieval, and incorporating keyword modifiers.

By minimizing hallucinations, Vectara enhances trust in AI-powered decision making. This approach is language-agnostic, allowing users to search across multiple languages. RAG can be used to establish question-answer databases, providing authoritative answers to users.
