title: 'ðŸ’¾ Vector Database'

We support `Chroma` and `Elasticsearch` as two vector database. 
`Chroma` is used as a default database.

### Elasticsearch
In order to use `Elasticsearch` as vector database we need to use App type `CustomApp`. 
```python
import os

from embedchain import CustomApp
from embedchain.config import ElasticsearchDBConfig
from embedchain.embedder.openai import OpenAiEmbedder
from embedchain.llm.openai import OpenAILlm
from embedchain.vectordb.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchDB

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

es_config = ElasticsearchDBConfig(
    # elasticsearch url or list of nodes url with different hosts and ports.
    es_url="http://localhost:9200",
    # pass named parameters supported by Python Elasticsearch client
    ca_certs="/path/to/http_ca.crt",
    basic_auth=("username", "password"),
)

es_app = CustomApp(llm=OpenAILlm(), embedder=OpenAiEmbedder(), db=ElasticsearchDB(config=es_config))
```
- `ElasticsearchDBConfig` accepts `es_url` as elasticsearch url or as list of nodes url with different hosts and ports. Additionally we can pass named parameters supported by Python Elasticsearch client.
