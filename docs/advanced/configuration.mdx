title: '⚙️ Custom configurations'
---

Embedchain is made to work out of the box. However, for advanced users we're also offering configuration options. All of these configuration options are optional and have sane defaults.

## Examples

### General

Here's the readme example with configuration options.

```python
import os
from embedchain import App
from embedchain.config import AppConfig, AddConfig, QueryConfig, ChunkerConfig
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions

# Example: set the log level for debugging
config = AppConfig(log_level="DEBUG")
naval_chat_bot = App(config)

# Example: specify a custom collection name
config = AppConfig(collection_name="naval_chat_bot")
naval_chat_bot = App(config)

# Example: define your own chunker config for `youtube_video`
chunker_config = ChunkerConfig(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100, length_function=len)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44", AddConfig(chunker=chunker_config))

add_config = AddConfig()
naval_chat_bot.add("https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf", config=add_config)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://nav.al/feedback", config=add_config)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://nav.al/agi", config=add_config)

naval_chat_bot.add(("Who is Naval Ravikant?", "Naval Ravikant is an Indian-American entrepreneur and investor."), config=add_config)

query_config = QueryConfig()
print(naval_chat_bot.query("What unique capacity does Naval argue humans possess when it comes to understanding explanations or concepts?", config=query_config))
```

### Custom prompt template

Here's the example of using custom prompt template with `.query`

```python
from embedchain.config import QueryConfig
from embedchain.embedchain import App
from string import Template
import wikipedia

einstein_chat_bot = App()

# Embed Wikipedia page
page = wikipedia.page("Albert Einstein")
einstein_chat_bot.add(page.content)

# Example: use your own custom template with `$context` and `$query` and additional custom variable `$year`
einstein_chat_template = Template("""
        You are Albert Einstein, a German-born theoretical physicist,
        widely ranked among the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.

        Use the following information about Albert Einstein to respond to
        the human's query acting as Albert Einstein.
        Context: $context

        Keep the response brief. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

        Human: $query
        Albert Einstein in or before the year $year:""")
query_config = QueryConfig(template=einstein_chat_template, system_prompt="You are Albert Einstein.")
queries = [
        "Where did you complete your studies?",
        "Why did you win nobel prize?",
        "Why did you divorce your first wife?",
]

for year in ["1909", "1954"]:
        print("In the year ", year)
        for query in queries:
                response = einstein_chat_bot.query(query, config=query_config, year=year)
                print("Query: ", query)
                print("Response: ", response)

# Output
# In the year  1909
# Query:  Where did you complete your studies?
# Response:   I completed my studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland.
# Query:  Why did you win nobel prize?
# Response:   "I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious."
# Query:  Why did you divorce your first wife?
# Response:   "I have been studying mathematics at a university and I find that my work is not making any progress."

# In the year  1954
# Query:  Where did you complete your studies?
# Response:   I completed my studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland.
# Query:  Why did you win nobel prize?
# Response:   "I won a Nobel Prize for my work on theoretical physics and the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. This was a crucial step in the development of quantum theory."
# Query:  Why did you divorce your first wife?
# Response:   "I was not able to live with my wife, and I had to take her away from me."
