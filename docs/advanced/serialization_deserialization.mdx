title: 'ðŸ¥’ Serialization/Deserialization'

## Introduction ðŸš€

Serialization and Deserialization allow you to maintain the state of individual bot instances across different user sessions. This means you can save computational resources and provide a seamless user experience by initializing bots from previously serialized states.


## Usage ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

**Serialization**: The `serialize()` method, a part of the bot instance, is pivotal for preserving bot states. It allows the bot instance to convert itself into a JSON-formatted string. 

To serialize, you'd typically use it like this: 

`serialized_bot = bot_instance.serialize()`. 

This JSON representation can be saved or transmitted.


**Deserialization:** After you've serialized the instance into a JSON string. When you're ready you can take the json string and load it to get back the same object, you can do so using `app = App.deserialize(json_string)`. 

The function returns a default instance on failure.
