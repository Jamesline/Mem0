To use GMAILLoader you must install the extra dependencies with `pip install --upgrade embedchain[dataloaders]`. Download your google credentials file from your deve account, follow instructions @`https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys` to download credentials, now rename the file to `token.json` and save it in the root folder of embedchain repo.

To load GMAIL messages, you MUST use the data_type as `gmail`. Otherwise the source will be detected as simple `text`.

The `source` must be a valid GMAIL search query, you can refer `https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en` to build a query.

```python
import os
from embedchain.apps.app import App
from embedchain.models.data_type import DataType
app = App()

query = "from: me label:inbox"
app.add(query, data_type=DataType.GMAIL)
app.query("Summarize my email conversations")
```
