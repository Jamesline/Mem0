Embedchain offers a Streamlit template to facilitate the development of RAG chatbot applications in just three easy steps.

Follow the instructions given below to deploy your first application quickly:

## Step-1: Create RAG app

We provide a command line utility called `ec` in embedchain that inherits the template for `streamlit.io` platform and help you deploy the app. Follow the instructions to create a streamlit.io app using the template provided:

```bash Install embedchain
pip install embedchain
```

```bash Create application
mkdir my-rag-app
ec create --template=streamlit.io
```

This will generate a directory structure like this:

```bash
├── .streamlit
│   └── secrets.toml
├── app.py
├── embedchain.json
└── requirements.txt
```

Feel free to edit the files as required.
- `app.py`: Contains API app code
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml`: Contains secrets for your application
- `embedchain.json`: Contains embedchain specific configuration for deployment (you don't need to configure this)
- `requirements.txt`: Contains python dependencies for your application

## Step-2: Test app locally

You can run the app locally by simply doing:

```bash Run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
ec dev
```

## Step-3: Deploy to streamlit.io

You can follow this [guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app) to deploy your app to streamlit.io platform.
