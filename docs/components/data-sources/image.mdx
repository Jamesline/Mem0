title: "üñºÔ∏è Image"
---


To use an image as data source, just add `data_type` as `image` and pass in the path of the image (local or hosted).

We use [GPT4 Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) to generate meaning of the image using a custom prompt, and then use the generated text as the data source.

You would require an OpenAI API key with access to `gpt-4-vision-preview` model to use this feature.

### Without customization

```python
import os
from embedchain import App

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxx"

app = App()
app.add("./Elon-Musk.webp", data_type="image")
response = app.query("Describe the man in the image.")
print(response)
# Answer: The man in the image is dressed in formal attire, wearing a dark suit jacket and a white collared shirt. He has short hair and is standing. He appears to be gazing off to the side with a reflective expression. The background is dark with faint, warm-toned vertical lines, possibly from a lit environment behind the individual or reflections. The overall atmosphere is somewhat moody and introspective.
```

### Customization

```python
import os
from embedchain import App
from embedchain.loaders.image import ImageLoader

image_loader = ImageLoader(
    max_tokens=100,
    api_key="sk-xxx",
    prompt="Is the person looking wealthy? Structure your thoughts around what you see in the image.",
)

app = App()
app.add("./Elon-Musk.webp", data_type="image", loader=image_loader)
response = app.query("Describe the man in the image.")
print(response)
# Answer: The man in the image appears to be well-dressed in a suit and shirt, suggesting that he may be in a professional or formal setting. His composed demeanor and confident posture further indicate a sense of self-assurance. Based on these visual cues, one could infer that the man may have a certain level of economic or social status, possibly indicating wealth or professional success.
```

### ZhiAI image loader
```python
from embedchain import App
from embedchain.loaders.zhipu_image import ImageLoader
import os
os.environ["ZHIPU_API_KEY"]="your-zhipu-api-key"
image_loader = ImageLoader(
    max_tokens=100,
    prompt="Please describe in detail what you see in the picture.",
)
config = {
  'llm': {
    'provider': 'zhipuai',
    'config': {
      'model': 'glm-4',
      'temperature':0.1,
      'top_p':0.1,
      "stream":False,
    }
  },
  'embedder': {
        'provider': 'zhipuai',
    }
}
app = App.from_config(config=config)
app.add("https://img1.baidu.com/it/u=1369931113,3388870256&fm=253&app=138&size=w931&n=0&f=JPEG&fmt=auto?sec=1703696400&t=f3028c7a1dca43a080aeb8239f09cc2f", data_type="image", loader=image_loader)
response = app.query("Please describe the clouds in the sky.")
print(response)
# Answer: The clouds in the sky are pure white and flawless, with various shapes. Some clouds are fluffy and light, as soft as cotton candy, while others are dense and heavy, as if indicating subtle changes in the weather. These clouds interweave into a beautiful picture in the vast sky, adding a touch of poetic and imaginative space.
