Supabase python client requires `vecs` library to be installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install vecs
```

In order to create a Supabase client to use it as a vector database, you need a connection
string "DB_Connection". You can get it from the Supabase dashboard. For more information, you can check the [official documentation](https://supabase.github.io/vecs/0.4/hosting/).

Set the connection string as an environment variable "POSTGRESS_CONNECTION_STRING".

    postgres_connection_string: "postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>"
